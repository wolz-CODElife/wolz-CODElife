<!--   <h1 align='center'>Hi there 👋🏾, I'm Joel Adewole</h1>  -->
  <p>Hi, I'm Joel Adewole, a Developer Relations Engineer with a background in software engineering and technical writing. I build example applications, write production-ready documentation, and create developer education that helps teams adopt complex platforms through real, runnable code. </p>
    <p>My work spans APIs, SDKs, Web3 systems, and developer onboarding, with experience across early-stage startups and global developer platforms.</p>
</p>

### What I Work On
- Example applications and demos for developer platforms
- API and SDK documentation
- Tutorials, how-to guides, and onboarding flows
- Developer education (learning paths, interactive courses, certification prep)
- Open-source documentation and tooling

### Highlight Projects
- [**GitHub Learn / GitHub Skills**](https://learn.github.com/) – Contributed to the design and development of interactive, hands-on learning courses that teach GitHub workflows through real examples.
- [**ERC-4626 Developer Documentation**](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/) – Authored and maintained a production-grade walkthrough for implementing tokenized vaults, referenced by the Ethereum ecosystem.
- [**Polygon Onboarding & SDKs**](https://docs.polygon.technology/pos/get-started/building-on-polygon/) – Built and consolidated documentation to reduce onboarding and integration friction for Polygon PoS.
- [BOUNTY](https://github.com/logos-messaging/bounties/issues/14) Build dApp of Your Choice Using Waku (Decentralized Communication) and Vue.js

### Open to Collaboration
I’m interested in collaborating on developer tooling, documentation, and education projects, especially around APIs, platform onboarding, and open-source ecosystems.
